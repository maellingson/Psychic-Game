# Psychic-Game

This is a work in progress. It requires a lot more work and is by no means finished. I just needed to turn it in. 

It generates a random letter and you can type in the console if you delete the last half of the code. It writes one letter to a blank page...not helpful. 

I am going to finish this and here's my action plan: 

1) Review the code in office hours to understand where things went wrong (a lot of things went wrong, so maybe cover the top 2-3)
2) Study over the weekend. I have some resources pulled to help to reinforce the material covered this week, but have not had time to sufficiently review because I've been working on this. 
3) Ask if there are any more resources that would be helpful. 
4) Practice writing in Javascript.
5) Study actual good working code. The code we've done in groups has been a mixed bag of working/not working and now I'm just confused.
